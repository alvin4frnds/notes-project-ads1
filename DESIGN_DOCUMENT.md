users (id, email, password, subscription_tier, created_at, updated_at)
user_api_credentials (id, user_id, platform, credentials_encrypted, is_active)
user_sessions (id, user_id, token_jti, expires_at, last_used_at)

-- Ad Management
ads (id, user_id, name, status, unified_data, targeting_data, budget_data)
ad_assets (id, ad_id, asset_id, asset_type, order_index)
assets (id, user_id, filename, file_size, mime_type, file_url)

-- Campaign Management
campaigns (id, ad_id, platform, platform_campaign_id, status, platform_data)
campaign_deployments (id, campaign_id, deployment_type, status, error_details)

-- Performance Metrics (Partitioned)
campaign_metrics (id, campaign_id, date, impressions, clicks, spend_amount)
campaign_metrics_hourly (id, campaign_id, hour_timestamp, impressions, clicks)

-- Reporting
reports (id, user_id, name, report_type, configuration, schedule)
report_instances (id, report_id, status, file_url, generated_at)
